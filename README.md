# ML Coding Samples
This GitHub repository contains Jupyter notebooks for sample ML coding tasks as completed by Gregg Tabot ([resume](RESUME.pdf)). New samples are added regularly. Some tasks are still WIP.

* [Multi-class Classification with a Neural Network](multiclass_classification_with_nn.ipynb) - Predicting NBA player position from advanced player stats
* [Transfer Learning Image Classification](transfer_learning_image_classification.ipynb) - Classifying NBA teams from images of NBA player profile pictures
* [Recommender System Using Collaborative Filtering](recommender_system_collaborative_filtering.ipynb) - Recommending movies to users based on the [`MovieLens`](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens) dataset
